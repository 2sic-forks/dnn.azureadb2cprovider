## Overview
The DNN Azure Active Directory B2C Provider is an Authentication provider for DNN Platform, which uses [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory-b2c) authentication to authorize users.

![Sign-in with Azure AD B2C](docs/images/AzureAdB2C_01.png  "Sign-in with Azure AD B2C")
![Sign-in with Azure AD B2C](docs/images/AzureAdB2C_02.png  "Sign-in with Azure AD B2C")

This provider can also retrieve all personal information stored in the user attributes in Azure B2C, so that the DNN account is synchronized with that data. All that information is sent as claims during the login process.

<a name="features"></a>
## Features
* Provides DNN Platform - Azure AD B2C integration by portal, so each portal on a DNN installation can setup their own Auth settings
* Allows auto-redirection, so users are automatically redirected to the Azure AD B2C login without seeing the DNN login page
* Supports the following policies (user flows):
  * Sign up/Sign in: users can register on Azure AD B2C and then login, or just login
  * Profile: users can update their user profile when clicking on the DNN user profile link
  * Reset password: users can initiate the reset password flow by clicking on the "forgot password" link available on the login screen
* When a user logins on Azure AD B2C, the B2C profile and roles are synchronized with DNN profile and DNN roles. If a role doesn't exist, is created in the process
* Supports User profile picture synchronization as part of the profile synchronization
* Supports JWT authorization. If enabled, developers can get a JWT auth token directly from Azure B2C login using the "Resource Owner" policy, and then use that token to call any DNN WebAPI Controller with the Auth scheme "JWT".
* Supports for 3rd party WebAPI integration through API Resource and scopes implementation

## Installation and configuration guide
To setup the provider, you need to complete three steps:
1. How to setup Azure Active Directory B2C
2. How to setup the Azure Active Directory application to support role and profile synchronization
3. How to install the authorization provider in our DNN deployment and how to setup the AD B2C parameters we created before

Following this two steps, you will give access to all your Azure AD B2C users to register and sign-in into your DNN application.

<a name="AADB2C-setup"></a>
### Step 1: Azure Active Directory B2C setup
The following are links to official Microsoft documentation for configuring your Azure AD B2C tenant. Once you have completed all these steps, your B2C tenant will be ready to work with your DNN site:
1. [Create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant)
2. [Register an application in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications)
3. [Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows). For the time being only the following user flows are supported:
   - [Sign-up and sign-in user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-sign-up-and-sign-in-user-flow)
   - [Password reset user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-password-reset-user-flow)
   - [Profile editing user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-profile-editing-user-flow)
4. Optional: [Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

**IMPORTANT**: when creating the policies (user flows), ensure the following claims are returned: "given_name", "family_name", "emails", "sub". If not specified, an authorization error will occur when redirected back to the DNN site after login.
To do that, on Azure Portal, go to your B2C Directory then click User flows (policies) on the left menu and select your policy. Then click on **Application claims** and make sure that **Given Name**, **Surname**, **Email Addresses** and **User's Object ID** are checked.

### Step 2: How to setup the Azure Active Directory application to support role and profile synchronization
To support the role and profile synchronization by internally using the Microsoft Graph API, a service principal is needed to call the API. To setup the service principal:

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com to setup the required applications on your Azure Active Directory. You need to use the user credentials of a user with at least "Service Admin" role. Note that this application is different from the one created previously on the B2C section, is a regular application on the Azure AD, not a B2C application.
2. In the left-hand navigation pane, click the Azure Active Directory service, click **App registrations (Legacy)**, and click **New application registration**.
3. When the **Create** page appears, enter your application's registration information:
    * **Name**: Enter a meaningful application name. This can be any name you want and is simply how you will identify the application in your Azure Active Directory (i.e. "My DNN MS Graph Application").
    * **Application type**: Select "Web app / API" (notice that Web Applications and Web APIâ€™s are considered the same type of application as far as Azure AD is concerned)
    * **Sign-On URL**: This is the URL where user can sign in and use your app. In a typical DNN site, this should be something like "http://mysite.com/Login". You can change this URL later.
4. <a name="applicationid"></a> When finished, click **Create**. Azure AD assigns a unique **Application ID** to your application, and you're taken to your application's main registration page.
5. Click on the name of the app we've just created and then on "All settings" > "Required permissions" > "Windows Azure Active Directory". Ensure that the app has, at least, **Sign in and read user profile** checked, in the **Delegated permissions** section.
6. Click on the **Grant permissions** button and then click on "Yes" to grant the permissions in all the accounts in the current directory.
7. <a name="getaadkey"></a> Now on the **Settings** page, under the **keys** section, create a new key with the desired expiration. Click on Save and then copy the key to a secure location. `IMPORTANT: you won't be able to copy this key later, so copy it now or generate a new one when needed.`

<a name="provider-configuration"></a>
### Step 3: DNN provider installation and configuration
It's important to remember that, if you want to use this module, you need a DNN deployment with  **version 9.3.0 or later**. 

1. Download the DNN Azure AD provider from the Releases folder (i.e. AzureAdB2CProvider_01.00.00_Install.zip) https://github.com/davidjrh/dnn.azureadb2cprovider/releases
2. Login into your DNN Platform website as a host user and install the provider from the `Host > Extensions` page
3. Use the **Install Extension Wizard** to upload and install the file you downloaded in step 1. Once installed, you can setup the provider from the new settings page, under the section **Azure AD B2C** in the Persona Bar:

![AAD B2C settings](docs/images/AzureAdB2C_02b.png  "AAD B2C settings")

The settings page is divided into general and advanced settings. 
1. GENERAL SETTINGS

To start, you can simply fill up the general settings:
* **Enabled**: Use this switch to enable/disable the Azure AD B2C provider
* **Auto-Redirect**: This option allows you to automatically redirect your login page to the Azure AD B2C login page. If for some reason you need to login with the legacy DNN auth (i.e. using a host user), you can pass the "legacy=1" parameter in your login URL (i.e. https://mysite.com/login?legacy=1)
* **Directory Tenant Name**: This is the name of your tenant. It's the name that's in your domain name, but without the ".onmicrosoft.com" part. For instance, if your domain name is _test123.onmicrosoft.com_, your tenant name is _test123_
* **Directory Tenant ID**: You can get this parameter from the **Properties** section of your Azure Active Directory (it's the value of the field **Directory ID**)
* **App ID**: This is the **Application ID** of the application you created in [step 1](#AADB2C-setup) of the previous section of this guide (the B2C application)
* **Secret**: This is the **Key** that you generated when you created the application in [step 1](#AADB2C-setup) of the previous section
* Policies (user flows):
  * **Sign up and/or sign in**: The name of your Sign-up or Sign-in policy that you created before (depending on if you want to support user registration or not)
  * **Profile**: The name of your profile policy that you created before
  * **Reset the password**: The name of the policy that you created before to reset the password

**IMPORTANT** if you are using the vanilla DNN Platform installation with the default settings, after a user successfully logins on B2C will the this message: "An email with your details has been sent to the Site Administrator for verification. You will be notified by email when your registration has been approved. In the meantime you can continue to browse this site.". 
With some configurations, this message is not even shown, but is the same situation. You can change this behavior by changing the site registration settings of your DNN website through *Site Settings > Security > Member Accounts > Registration Settings > User Registration* and set the setting to "Public".
Also note that changing the setting, does not "verify" the users that are waiting for verification, so you probably need to go and authorize that user through the DNN Users maintenance (remember to select the "Unauthorized" users on the users maintenance window to see who is pending for verification).

![AAD B2C settings](docs/images/AzureAdB2C_03.png  "AAD B2C settings")

2. ADVANCED SETTINGS

For advanced scenarios, check the advanced settings:
* Synchronization:
  * **Role Sync**: enables the role sync after user signin, and let the DNN scheduler task to sync all the B2C roles, every 3 hours by default (this can affect login performance)
  * **Profile Sync**: enables profile sync after user sigin, including the profile picture (this can affect login performance)
  * **Application Id**: the application ID of the application created in [step 2](#AAD-setup) of the previous section of this guide (the Azure AD application, not the B2C)
  * **Application Key**: the secret of the application mentioned above
* JWT Authorization:
  * **Enable JWT authorization**: enables the possibility of using JWT tokens created by directly using the Azure AD B2C API, and then call a DNN WebAPI controller decorated with the attribute `[DnnAuthorize(AuthTypes = "JWT")]`. An example of this controller, can be found in `DotNetNuke.Authentication.Azure.B2C\Services\HelloController.cs`. See "Hello" sample for more information.
  * **Audiences**: audiences, separated by commas, to validate on a JWT token when JWT authorization is used. If the field is empty, by default the B2C application Id is used as default audience.
* API Resource. If you are going to use the issued tokens to access an external WebAPI that uses B2C authorization, you can specify the App ID URI and scopes that wil be validated by that WebAPI
  * **App ID Uri**: The App ID Uri of the external WebAPI, obtained from the Azure portal (i.e. https://mytenant.onmicrosoft.com/myapi/)
  * **Scopes**: The scopes separated by spaces, that will be include in the issued tokens, to be validated by the external WebAPI (i.e. "read write")

# Samples
Under the "samples" directory, you will find some samples that will show some integration scenarios, like integration mobile apps with DNN by using Azure AD B2C JWT auth tokens:
* [samples/hello](samples/Hello): a simple console App, that allows you to login with a username and password into Azure AD B2C, and then call a DNN WebAPI controller
* [samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnet-webapp-and-webapi](samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnet-webapp-and-webapi): slight modified version of the sample available on the Microsoft Azure B2C repo samples, with a webapp and a webapi consuming Azure AD B2C. Modification to setup CORS, to allow the DNN module example work with the webapi.
* [samples/SPA-WebAPI-Client](samples/SPA-WebAPI-Client): a To-do list DNN module example, that calls an external WebAPI by using B2C JWT tokens.
